# ARM Mali driver for VIA VAB-600

Driver source code for Mali graphics used on the [VIA VAB-600][vab600]
board.

Due to ARM's licensing requirements, only some part of the driver is open source,
while the core `libMali.so` and `libUMP.so` libraries are proprietary and provided
as precompiled binaries.

_This release is a work in progress._
